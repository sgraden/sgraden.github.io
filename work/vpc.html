                    The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) project is the next evolution for the infrastructure offerings of IBM Cloud. Prior to the release of VPC, IBM Cloud Infrastructure was offering the same services as their acquisition, Softlayer, had been providing for years. The Softlayer suite of offerings were very similar management experiences to having a physical datacenter. Relative to competition, it just wasn’t as flexible, simple, or private. 

	                VPC offerings were upgrades on the hardware and software of the Softlayer infrastructure. These upgrades made it easier for our clients to grow and evolve their applications while maintaining a more isolated environment.

                    <b>Virtual Private Cloud</b> - The core networking component required for creating any application. A VPC is an isolated virtual network that creates a buffer to keep all of your other services away from public networks and other clients on the IBM network. However, it still maintains the flexibility to customize the network exactly how your application needs.

                <p>
                    <b>Subnets</b> - A smaller subsection of your VPC. This network designates a range of IP addresses other services can use to communicate. Individual subnets operate as communication zones for everything in the subnet, but a client can place specific security requirements when communicating in and out of the subnet.

                <p>
                    <b>Public Gateway</b> - A service placed on a subnet to allow services on that subnet to initiate communication to the public internet through this gateway using Network Address Translation.

                <p>
                    <b>Floating IP</b> - A publicly addressable IP address placed on a Virtual Server’s Network Interface Card. Use this to make an application, like a website, reachable.

                <p>
                    <b>Custom Images</b> - Custom images are a copy of everything on a computer. That includes the operating system and anything installed or saved to that computer’s memory. To operate at scale, clients create and destroy massive numbers of
