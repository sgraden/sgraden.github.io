					<h3>Conference Space:</h3>
					<p>		
						The BEST WESTERN PLUS Vista Inn at the Airport has just over 4,400 square feet of meeting space, offering a variety of room sizes and set-ups. Our Summit and Tablerock rooms are both equipped with permanent conference tables and captains chairs and are perfect for smaller board meetings, interviews or brainstorming sessions. Our newly built Rocky Mountain Conference Center is 3,009 square feet of beautifully decorated banquet space holding up to 300 guests, and is divisible into three smaller rooms as well, making it perfect for everything from seminars and tradeshows to receptions. All conference rooms include telephone, wireless high-speed Internet access, temperature controls, and on-site meeting coordinator. We provide tables and linens for no additional charge.

					<h3>Catering Sevices:</h3>
					<p>
						The BEST WESTERN PLUS Vista Inn at the Airport has endless flexible catering options with the customer's needs in mind. Instead of having on-site exclusive caterer you must see; we work with numerous professional caterers and restaurants in the area to provide the perfect fit for your event and budget. Our conference coordinators are happy to assist with menu planning and arrangements. We do also allow meeting clients to arrange their own refreshments/catering as well if preferred. However, alcohol must go through a licensed venue such as professional caterer or bar.
